I recently conducted an analysis using SQL to study tech layoffs and the trends surrounding them. Through this analysis, I was able to answer questions such as which companies had the highest number of layoffs, which industries saw the most layoffs, and which types of companies were most affected.

I also delved into the data to discover which year had the most layoffs and which weekdays saw the highest number of layoffs. Overall, the analysis provided valuable insights into the tech industry and the effects of layoffs on companies and employees.

I'm thrilled to share my findings with you in this PowerPoint presentation, where I've included the queries I used to generate my results. I hope you find this information as informative and useful as I did!

"Excited to share my latest analysis on tech layoffs using SQL!" After analyzing data , I was able to answer some interesting questions, such as which company had the most layoffs, which industry had the highest number of layoffs, and which year had the most layoffs. I also dug deeper to find out which types of companies were most affected by layoffs and even which days of the week saw the most layoffs.

To showcase my findings, I put together a PowerPoint presentation featuring some eye-catching visualizations that really help bring the data to life. I'm thrilled to share this with the community and hope it sparks some insightful conversations around the current state of the tech industry.
