/*Assume you are given the table containing measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over several days. Measurements are taken several 
times within a given day.
Write a query to obtain the sum of the odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements on a particular day, in two different columns. Refer to the 
Example Output below for the output format.
Definition:
â€¢1st, 3rd, and 5th measurements taken within a day are considered odd-numbered measurements and the 2nd, 4th, and 6th measurements are even-numbered measurements.*/
