/*New TikTok users sign up with their emails and each user receives a text confirmation to activate their account. Assume you are given the below tables about 
emails and texts.
Write a query to display the ids of the users who did not confirm on the first day of sign-up, but confirmed on the second day.
Assumption:
â€¢action_date is the date when the user activated their account and confirmed their sign-up through the text.*/

--I have answered  SQL question that was asked in a job interview at Tik Tok.

SELECT user_id 
FROM emails e
join texts t
on e.email_id = t.email_id
where t.action_date = e.signup_date + INTERVAL '1 day'
